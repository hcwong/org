#+TITLE: Instant Noodles

My Review of various brands of instant noodles.

* Kang Shi Fu Xiang La Niu Rou Mian
Strong broth let down by the terrible noodles. Would not recommend.
** MSG 3.5/5
Nice and Spicy. Strong Taste of MSG and numbs your mouth.
** Noodles 0/5
The noodles are terrible. Less chew than beehoon. On par with Myojo chicken instant noodles. This noodle came as part of a jumbo pack so its just x1.5 the trash.
