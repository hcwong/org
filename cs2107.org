* Lecture 1

** Definitions
1. *Threat* is the set of circumstances that have an ability to harm
2. *Vulnerability* is the weakness is the system

This is commonly generalized as the *asset-threat-vulnerability-control model*.

1. *Confidentiality* is to ensure that info is only viewed by authorized parties. Also known as privacy
2. *Integrity* is to ensure that asset is only modified by authorized party
3. *Availability* is to ensure that asset can only be used by authorized party

** Encryption
Cryptology vs Cryptography - Study of codes vs study of techniques in securing comms in the presence of adversaries.

Encrpytion is one of the primitives in cryptography.

*** Requirements for encryption
1. \(D_k(E_k(x))\) where \(k\) is the key. This is known as correctness.
2. Must be difficult to get useful information from the ciphertext.
3. Efficent decryption and encryption. (polynomial time)
