* Chapter 1: Basics
** Immutabiity
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
const // means that the value will not be changed
constexpr // means that an expression will be evaluated at compiled time - to specify constants
// and to place data in read only memory
#+END_SRC
** For Loops
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
for (auto &x: arr) // to get a reference
for (auto x: {1,2,3,4})
#+END_SRC

On that note, references are similar to a pointer, but you don't need to dereference it to use the value.
A reference also cannot be modified to refer to a different object.
