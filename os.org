** Bootloading
Recap: Broadly speaking, the OS is just an abstraction over the hardware, mainly recap from CS2106

Instructions for booting are typically found in the *BIOS* chip. BIOS chip points towards the bootloader. Bootloader pokes around at I/O ports in a process called *autoprobing*. They also help to start the kernel.
For historical reasons the original program was kept as small as possible.

The above steps are usually called the first stage. After this, the kernel starts an init process, my guess is that this is the process with pid 0.
This init process does things like check whether the disks are okay and to spawn daemons and prepares for users.

Of course, there can be more than two stages in a bootloader. This is known as chain loading.

CMU has quite a detailed guide on how to write a bootloader [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410-s07/p4/p4-boot.pdf)
